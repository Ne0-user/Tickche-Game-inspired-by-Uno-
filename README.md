Tickche

Tickche is a small interactive project built with Pygame that showcases the practical use of classical data structures inside a visual and dynamic environment.
The project includes custom-designed cards and uses several manually implemented structures to manage game behavior and card flow.

Project Description

Tickche is a inspired game with the porpuse to learn and apply data structures:

*LinkedList

*CircularLinkedList

*Stack

These structures are used to store, manage, and interact with the game’s card system. Each card features a unique design, visually rendered using Pygame. 
The goal of Tickche is to apply the data structures in a real program and learn how they can be applied.

Main Features:

*Custom implementations of LinkedList, CircularLinkedList, and Stack.

*Unique card designs created specifically for this project.

*Built entirely with Pygame, handling rendering, input, and animations.

*Modular and clean architecture for easy understanding and future expansion.

*Great for learning how data structures can be used in interactive projects.
